    <p> Full stack development refers to the development of both front end(client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application.Full stack web developers have the ability to design complete web application and websites. They work on the frontend, backend, database and debugging of web application or websites. Front end developers build out the visible parts of a website – what the user can see and interact with. In order to become a front-end developer you need to know HTMl, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) – this is like the skeleton of the body, because it gives it a website structure. Every site you visit is built using HTML, which handles the structure and the content of the site. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) – you can think of CSS as the aesthetics and muscles of the body! CSS makes a site beautiful and interesting to look at. Just like in your body where muscles and skin make you beautiful, CSS does the same for a website. It sets the fonts and colors, adds images, and even helps make the site responsive. JavaScript – like the brain of the operation that tells everything how to behave. JS is a gamechanger in web development as it gives a site all its functionality.</p>
